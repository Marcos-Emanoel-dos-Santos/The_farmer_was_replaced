# Useful modules

This directory contains useful modules that may work in any farm.
They can be used by using
```python
import module_name
```

Some modules need others to work properly, but that will always be specified as a comment in the beginning of the module file. Note that every module has it's .py and .md file.
The .py file may be used directly in the game, while the .md file contains help about the functions.
